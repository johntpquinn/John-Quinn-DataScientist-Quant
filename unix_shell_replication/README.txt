Below is the README with which I enclosed this submission for Harvard's CS61 class (Fall 2016.)  Substantial credit is due
to Professors Eddie Koehler and Margo Seltzer, as well as their staff.   The entirety of the unit testing, check.pl, and
parser-tokenizer, helpers.c, were, in fact, provided by them (Retrieved from https://github.com/cs61), and the student's work, as one of the requirements, was the addition the functionality to the provided starter code in sh61.c (only) in order to
emulate the required Unix shell commands in that C source code file.

This package was developed in the provided Oracle VirtualBoxVM (Linux Ubuntu/ GCC compiler).  While enclosed are
executables, etc. within your own environment you may need to make changes. 

To perform that provided unit testing, you can simply enter "make check" from your console to run all tests.
To perform one test, e.g., TestN, you can enter "make check-N" (with N replaced by that integer.)   To perform
a sequence of tests, you can, e.g., enter "make check-M-N" with M replaced by the integer of the earlier test
and N that of the later test.
