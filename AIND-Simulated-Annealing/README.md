Below are the instructions from Udacity for this mini-project, Simulated Annealing.   It is part of the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nano-Degree ("AIND") program.  Retrieved from https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Simulated_Annealing.

Simulated annealing is a techinique that uses gradient descent.   Its primary purpose and methodology is to shake the fabric of environment in descending orders of magnitude, in the process seeking the global optimum while concurrently avoiding local optima.

In this exercise you will check your understanding of simulated annealing by implementing the algorithm in a Jupyter notebook and using it to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals.

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Simulated_Annealing.ipynb
