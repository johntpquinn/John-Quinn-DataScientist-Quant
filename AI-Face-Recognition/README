It is strongly suggested that the user create a new virtual environment, 
preferably on a new machine image.   A list of dependencies is included in 
requirements.txt, and, in particular, those downloaded 
from opencv-contrb-python may conflict with classes from other 
versions of opencv.

All of these jupyter notebooks and helper files were run on a T2 instance
of AWS EC2.   It is highly recommended that the user also run these
applications on such hardware, particularly Solutions 3 and 3A.

Please, AS A FIRST STEP, create a directory entitled 'mlnd-capstone'
and install all of the attachments in it.   Through these files
I have used such director/folder name as the project_folder, and
using a different folder name may cause Solutions not to run.

Solution 1 automatically downloads the dataset and places it in your
home directory.   In ec2, this is home/ubuntu.   Please run this
on such an instance, as another home directory name will likely cause
Solutions not to run.

Solution 3, on its first run, will automatically download the model
created for keras-vggface.

Solution 3A does a good bit of directory creation, file copying and the
like.   So as to allow the user to extricate the rather large database
downloaded with Solution 1, all such directories and file copies have
been placed further down the tree from the root of Solution 1.   Once
done with this exercise the user can remove all files and directories,
including those created in Solution 3A with a simple command line 
interface ("CLI") entry of rm -rf scikit_learn_data from his or her home
directory.
