Assignment 1
README

FILES INCLUDED WITHIN .ZIP:

All included files are those required by the design document and specifications.  The few that need more clarification are:

1. ImportException.java (see Review.pdf)
2. QueryEngineException.java (See Review.pdf)
3. All other documents with suffix .txt in their name:   Each one with name beginning “outFrom_” is the output from the input file whose name begins with the balance of that output file’s name.

USING AND TESTING THE IMPLEMENTATION:

To test specifically-required functionality, one needs only enter the exact two command line instructions (“CLIs”) listed on Page 3 of the assignment itself.

To run the other three tests provided, one needs only replace “inputQueries.txt” (i.e., the last argument of the 2nd of the two CLIs) with the name of the desired other query file.
